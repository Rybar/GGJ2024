**Protagonist (confused):** "What was that about? Did he say 'Make Me Looff'?"

**Granny (squinting, a bit hard of hearing):** "What'd he say, dear? 'Make Meatloaf'? Is that it?"

**Protagonist (still confused but going along):** "Um, I guess so, Granny. 'Make Meatloaf'...? I mean, I’ve never heard of such a contest, but..."

**Granny (excitedly):** "Oh, that's wonderful! You can make my famous family recipe meatloaf! It's been a winner at every church potluck!"

**Protagonist (half-heartedly):** "Yeah, Granny, but the only contests I’ve ever done are eating contests and, well, making things to eat contests."

**Granny (beaming with pride):** "Then it's perfect! You were born for this, love! My meatloaf recipe in your hands? Unbeatable!"

**Protagonist (realizing they can't back out now):** "Well, I guess we’re doing this. But Granny, the contest is 2000 miles away!"

**Granny (determined):** "Then there's no time to waste! You’ll just have to practice making it while we drive. It'll be a grand adventure!"
