## Intro script
Close up on an old answering machine. Audio is distorted, recorded on too-many-times-used analog tape.

#### [Sound of a beep, indicating the start of a recorded message]

British Celebrity (Excitedly, with a thick brit accent): "Hello, hello! This is your moment to shine in the spotlight! It's Arthur Worthington, reaching out to all the stars-to-be out there!"

#### [Voice returns to being over-the-top for a closing statement]

"Chop-chop! Time's ticking, and fame waits for no one! Can't wait to see what you've got up your sleeve. Cheerio, and best of luck!"

#### [Sound of the beep, indicating the end of the message]

**Protagonist (confused):** "What was that about? Did he say 'Make Me Looff'?"

**Granny (squinting, a bit hard of hearing):** "What'd he say, dear? 'Make Meatloaf'? Is that it?"

**Protagonist (still confused but going along):** "Um, I guess so, Gramma. 'Make Meatloaf'...? I mean, I ain' never heard of such a contest, but..."

**Granny (excitedly):** "Oh, that's wonderful! You can make my famous family recipe meatloaf! It's been a winner at every church potluck!"

**Protagonist (half-heartedly):** "Yeah,I dunno Gramnma.."

**Granny (beaming with pride) interrupting:** "Tt's perfect! You were born for this, love! My meatloaf recipe in your hands? Unbeatable!"

**Protagonist (realizing they can't back out now):** "Well, I guess we’re doing this. But Granny, the contest is 2000 miles away!"

**Granny (determined):** "Then there's no time to waste! You’ll just have to practice making it while we drive. It'll be a grand adventure!"

## Gameplay and Mechanics

### Core Gameplay

- **Setting:** Inside a moving RV with a makeshift kitchen.
- **Objective:** Prepare the perfect meatloaf under challenging conditions.

## Mini Games

### Crack eggs game
- use analog sticks and triggers to pick up eggs from carton. 
- triggers must be held halfway down to avoid crushing eggs
- both hands must be pinching (correct position and trigger held down) to crack egg without dropping shells. 
- After cracking, pinch must be maintained and positions moved apart over bowl. Moving towards each other results in crushed shells falling in
- Letting go of a pinch results in shells falling
- Pinching too hard at any point results in crushed eggshells falling
- Goal: eggs in the bowl, no shells. 

### Mix the loaf game
- poorly fit gloves mean another balancing game.  Move the analog sticks to push your hands into the goop and turn it over.
- Pushing your hand in too far means your glove starts to fall off. Pinch (pull trigger) to keep your glove on.
- Losing a glove means half your points for this game lost. 
- Thoroughly mix the meatloaf in the time allotted 
- Mix just right for perfect score 
- Penalty for under mixed or over mixed

### Shape the meatloaf game
- a border representing the desired shape appears. 
- Push the pink mass in around the edges to make it match the shape of the border
- Too far pushed can’t be undone
- Pushing is done by positioning your hand at edge of meat mass and pulling the trigger, then moving the analog stick in the desired push direction.  Speed is determined by trigger pressure.  
- Goal: perfect shape. Scored by over/under and percentage shape filled.  

### Cook the meatloaf game
- grandmas toaster oven requires you to hold the plug into the wall, and bumps in the road reset the temperature and the timer.  Watch and Correct the timer and temp when granny hits a bump in the road. 
- The correctness of your corrections and number of times you lose power affect the score of this round. 

### Sauce the meatloaf game
- use one hand to squirt sauce and the other to evenly spread the sauce over the outside of the meatloaf. 
- Sauce is prone to dripping, and the game is timed
- Score is determined by number of drips and coverage percentage when timer goes off. 

### Daily results scene, grandma taste test
- grandma tastes the meatloaf and gives you a quality score based on your scores in the mini games.  

## Finale

### End of week game: makeshift food truck
- you sell slices of meatloaf from the meatloaves you made all week for a set period of time.
- demand is determined by meatloaf scores.  
- Before the round starts, you have the chance to rearrange the order you sell your meatloaf slices in (so you can put your best meatloaf in the middle, beginning or end).
- Meatloaf counter has a costumer, you grab a slice and bring it to the window.  
- Score is determined by quality of meatloaf, number of customers served, and quality of the meatloaf chosen to be on the selling counter 

## Art and Audio

### Visual Style and Design Notes

- **Sound Effects:** RV movements, RV motor sounds, kitchen clanks, eggs cracking, gross moist squelches, old oven timers
